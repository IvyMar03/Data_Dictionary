# IA-6 – Data Dictionary

## Description
This program uses a Python dictionary to represent structured data (a "data dictionary") and perform basic analysis or lookups. The goal of this assignment is to practice:
- Organizing data with keys and values
- Accessing and updating dictionary entries
- Using loops and conditions to work with dictionary content


## Concepts Used
- Dictionaries (`dict`)
- Keys, values, and dictionary methods
- Loops (`for` loops) over dictionary items
- Conditional statements (`if/elif/else`)
- Input and output with `input()` and `print()`
- Basic data validation (depending on version)

## How to Run
1. Open the `.py` file in PyCharm or another Python IDE.
2. Run the program.
3. Follow any on-screen prompts to:
   - View or search data in the dictionary
   - Display summary information or calculated results.
